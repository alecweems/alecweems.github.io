                <p>Hello! My name is Alec, and I’m new to programming! I have a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Psychology
                    from the Lynchburg College (now University of Lynchburg) in 2015. I met my wife, Megan while in
                    college,
                    and we got married in April 2017. We have two dogs, a shih-tzu, Romo who I’ve had since 2009 and a
                    junior in High School. And a brindle boxer/pitbull mix Callaway (Cal) which Megan and I adopted a
                    week
                    before we graduated from college. We currently live in Richmond, Va.</p>
                <p>I started working in 2008 at a movie theater (shout-out Carmike!!) and did everything from sell
                    tickets and popcorn, to replacing the marquee posters and constructing promotional material. When
                    the theater was bought in 2011 and I was in college, I started working at the Country Club of
                    Virginia (CCV) over my summer break. I started at CCV as a valet, and worked through the summer of
                    2012. When I returned for the summer of 2013, I worked in the Support Services Department and helped
                    set up the various ballrooms and boardrooms for the Club’s events. I did not return to CCV after the
                    summer of 2013. I found another job at a country club in Lynchburg and with my CCV experience, was
                    able to start working immediately at Oakwood Country Club (OCC) as a Grill Room server. Oakwood is a
                    place that will always hold a special place in my heart, I met and worked with a lot of great
                    people. I worked at OCC from January 2014 until June 2015. In those 17 months, I was promoted to
                    Banquet Captain, and then 5 months later, I was promoted to Director of Membership and Events.
                    Eventually, my time with Oakwood was coming to an end; I wanted to move back closer to Richmond and
                    begin my life with Megan. Once we graduated from college in May of 2015, I began looking for work
                    closer to me and Megan’s families. In the spring of 2016 I began working in Richmond at Managed
                    Health Care Associates, a pharmaceutical GPO, and my position is Associate Account Manager of Retail
                    Chains and State Accounts. Most of my responsibilities are clerical, I manage paperwork and ensure
                    our members are linked to our wholesaler contracts.
