## About Me Page

I spent time at first, writing my "About Me" and organizing my thoughts there.  After I did that, I used Bootstrap to pull in my NavBar and edited the "nav-items" to show the "About", "Contact", and "Portfolio" buttons.

I then edited the colors of the NavBar to match the parameters from the first homework assignment.  I used the bootstrap grid to set columns for my images and text.  I do need to spend some extra time reviewing how to wrap the text of the final paragraph below the bottom image, but still in the container.

## Portfolio

I followed similar steps to create the container for the cards to go in.  I linked my GitHub main page to one card, Week 1's Homework to a card, the Class Pre-Work to a card, and one of our in-class activities that I had saved.

## Contact

This one was a little tougher because at first, I had forgotten to put the boxes in a container.  Everything was sitting on the far left edge which was frustrating.  But I got it figured out and everything looks nice and centered.
